# Basis Universal Texture Compression Demo for Unreal Engine 5

## Motivation

Install size directly affects user acquisition and retention across virtually all game categories. Players who hesitate to download a large game, or who delete it during a storage cleanup, are customers lost. Keeping package size as small as possible is a genuine business concern, not just a technical preference.

### The problem with today's GPU texture formats

UE5 developers can already choose compression formats per texture — BC1, BC5, BC7, ASTC, and so on. But all of these are **GPU-native formats with fixed bitrates**:

| Format | Bitrate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| BC1 | 4 bpp | fixed |
| BC5 | 4 bpp | fixed |
| BC7 | 8 bpp | fixed |
| ASTC 4×4 | 8 bpp | fixed |
| ASTC 8×8 | 2 bpp | fixed |

There is no intermediate option. A developer who wants something between BC1 and BC7 has no choice. And regardless of format, developers must make separate format decisions for each target platform — BC7 for PC, ASTC for mobile — duplicating cook passes and pak storage.

Unreal Engine 5's **Oodle Texture RDO** improves on this by making GPU block data more compressible inside the pak, with no quality cost. But it is still bound by these fixed bitrate floors — it cannot compress below what the GPU format physically requires.

### What Basis Universal makes possible

**Basis Universal** introduces a fundamentally different tradeoff space. XUASTC LDR alone spans **0.3 to 5.7 bpp** continuously across block sizes 4×4 through 12×12:

| Block size | Bitrate |
|---|---|
| XUASTC 4×4 | 5.7 bpp |
| XUASTC 6×6 | ~2.5 bpp |
| XUASTC 8×8 | 2.0 bpp |
| XUASTC 10×10 | 1.3 bpp |
| XUASTC 12×12 | 0.9 bpp |

This continuous space means a developer can allocate quality precisely — higher bitrate for hero assets seen up close, lower bitrate for distant or secondary textures — rather than jumping between coarse fixed formats.

More importantly, **a single Basis Universal (KTX2) asset transcodes to any GPU-native format at runtime**: BC5/BC7 on PC, ASTC on mobile. The developer never specifies a platform-specific format. One asset, one cook pass, one pak file serves all platforms.

The long-term goal of this project is to expose this capability directly in the UE5 texture pipeline: the developer sets a quality level, and the engine handles format selection and platform transcoding automatically. This repository is the proof-of-concept demonstrating these properties in UE5, along with a [Roadmap](#roadmap) toward full pipeline integration.

## Results

All comparisons are made against a **fair baseline**: the Standard build has Oodle Texture RDO enabled (`FinalRDOLambda=30`), which is Epic's own technology for optimizing GPU texture block data before pak compression.

| | Standard (BC1/BC5 + Oodle RDO) | Basis (ETC1S + XUASTC LDR 8x8) |
|---|---|---|
| **Pak size** | 178.0 MB | **152.7 MB (−14.5%)** |
| **Texture data in pak** | 39.1 MB | **13.8 MB (−64.7%)** |

> The pak contains substantial shared shader data (~138 MB) identical in both builds. The texture-only reduction of **−64.7%** represents the actual compression improvement, which translates to proportionally larger savings in texture-heavy real-world projects.

### Mobile (ASTC devices)

| | ASTC 4×4 raw | ASTC 8×8 raw | XUASTC LDR 8×8 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Disk (10 normal maps) | ~40 MB (estimated) | ~10 MB (estimated) | **8.3 MB (measured)** |
| Bitrate | 8 bpp | 2 bpp | 2 bpp + supercompression |
| Runtime decode cost | native | native | ~33 ms (decompress only) |

The size reduction breaks down into two independent contributions:

1. **Block size: 4×4 → 8×8** — reduces raw bitrate from 8 bpp to 2 bpp, a 4× reduction. This is a quality/size tradeoff available with standard ASTC as well.
2. **XUASTC supercompression** — Weight Grid DCT + RDO applied on top of the ASTC 8×8 block data, reducing ~10 MB to **8.3 MB** (an additional ~17%). General-purpose pak compression cannot achieve this because GPU texture data is already entropy-coded.

The measured 8.3 MB figure is the KTX2 file size. ASTC figures are theoretical estimates (raw block size × texture count); an actual mobile cook with Oodle RDO would be somewhat smaller.

On ASTC-capable devices, XUASTC LDR 8×8 decompresses directly to native ASTC 8×8 blocks with nearly zero transcoding overhead (~33 ms for supercompression removal only).

### Single pak for all platforms (design goal)

A key architectural advantage of the Basis Universal approach is that **one KTX2 file can serve every target platform**. The Basis Universal transcoder supports transcoding to any GPU-native format at runtime:

| Platform | Transcodes to | Cost (measured on PC) |
|---|---|---|
| PC / Console (DX12/Vulkan) | BC5_RG (normal) | ~128 ms / 2048×2048 |
| PC / Console (DX12/Vulkan) | BC7 (albedo) | ~397 ms / 2048×2048 |
| Mobile (ASTC) | ASTC 8×8 | ~33 ms / 2048×2048 |
| Mobile (ETC2 fallback) | ETC2 | supported by transcoder |

> **Note**: This demo targets Win64 only. The mobile transcoding path is supported by the underlying `basist::ktx2_transcoder` but has not been tested on device in this prototype. Full multi-platform support is part of the [Roadmap](#roadmap).

In a standard UE5 multi-platform build, the cook process generates separate platform-specific paks — BC5/BC7 for PC, ASTC for iOS/Android — each requiring its own cook pass and storage. With Basis Universal, a single pak could ship to all platforms and transcoding would happen once at load time, simplifying the build pipeline.

## What is XUASTC LDR?

XUASTC LDR is a supercompressed ASTC format introduced in **Basis Universal v2.10**. It applies Weight Grid DCT + RDO supercompression on top of ASTC blocks, achieving bitrates from 0.3 to 5.7 bpp across block sizes 4×4 through 12×12.

Key properties:
- **Explicitly supports normal maps** (documented in official Basis Universal spec)
- **KTX2 container** with `KTX2_SS_XUASTC_LDR` supercompression scheme
- **Transcodes to any GPU format** at runtime: BC5, BC7, ASTC, ETC2, etc.
- **`BASISD_SUPPORT_XUASTC=1` is the default** in the Basis Universal transcoder

This demo uses **XUASTC LDR 8×8 (2 bpp)** for normal maps and **ETC1S** for albedo textures.

### Quality

| Format | PSNR (2048×2048 normal map) |
|---|---|
| UASTC LDR 4×4 | 33.4 dB |
| XUASTC LDR 8×8 | 27.2 dB |

XUASTC LDR 8×8 at 27.2 dB PSNR was visually acceptable in this demo scene under typical viewing conditions. Results may vary with close-up inspection or grazing-angle lighting.

### Runtime transcoding (per 2048×2048 texture)

| Target format | Time |
|---|---|
| BC5_RG (normal maps) | ~128 ms |
| BC7_RGBA | ~397 ms |
| ASTC 8×8 (mobile) | ~33 ms |

## Requirements

- Unreal Engine 5.7
- Visual Studio 2022
- [basisu CLI](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal/releases) (for encoding KTX2 files)
- Source textures: 2K PNG normal maps and albedo maps

---

## Workflow

### 1. Encode normal maps to XUASTC LDR 8×8

```powershell
.\encode_normals_xuastc8x8.ps1
```

Encodes all `*nor_dx*.png` files in `source_textures/` to KTX2 using:
```
basisu <input>.png -ldr_8x8i -normal_map -quality 128 -effort 6 -output_file <output>.ktx2
```

### 2. Deploy KTX2 files

```powershell
.\deploy_xuastc8x8.ps1
```

Copies encoded KTX2 files to the UE project's `basis_textures/` source directory.

### 3. Reimport into UE5

```powershell
.\run_reimport_normals.ps1
```

Runs `reimport_normals_uastc.py` via `UnrealEditor-Cmd.exe` to reimport KTX2 assets.

### 4. Package

```powershell
# Basis build (ETC1S albedo + XUASTC 8x8 normals)
.\package_basis_nobuild.ps1

# Standard build (BC1/BC5 + Oodle Texture RDO)
.\package_standard_timed.ps1
```

## Plugin Implementation Notes

- Normal maps (filename contains `_nor_`) are transcoded to **BC5_RG** — the correct 2-channel GPU format for DX normal maps.
- All other textures use **RGBA32** for broad UE5 compatibility.
- The transcoder uses `basist::ktx2_transcoder`, which handles UASTC+Zstd, XUASTC LDR, and ETC1S natively (`BASISD_SUPPORT_XUASTC=1` by default).
- `PrivatePCHHeaderFile` is set to a plugin-local PCH to avoid loading the 2+ GB shared UE editor PCH on every incremental build.

## Background

This demo was developed to evaluate Basis Universal as a practical texture compression pipeline for Unreal Engine 5, with a focus on:

1. **Accurate comparison** — enabling Oodle Texture RDO on the Standard build ensures a fair baseline
2. **XUASTC LDR discovery** — demonstrating the first known UE5 integration of the XUASTC LDR format
3. **Mobile-first potential** — XUASTC 8×8 → ASTC 8×8 transcoding is nearly free on mobile hardware (~33 ms), and the KTX2 supercompression achieves significantly smaller disk sizes than shipping raw ASTC blocks

---

## Roadmap

This repository is a proof of concept. The goal is to evolve it into a fully integrated UE5 texture compression pipeline with a simple developer experience: **set a quality level, and the engine handles the rest** — format selection, platform transcoding, and pak optimization — automatically.

### 1. UE5 Texture Pipeline Integration

Currently, Basis Universal assets are imported through a custom factory (`BasisTextureFactory`) and loaded via a separate loader class. This requires a parallel asset management workflow alongside standard `UTexture2D` assets.

The target architecture is a native UE5 `ITextureFormat` plugin that hooks into the standard compression pipeline:

- **Quality-driven format selection**: The developer selects a quality level (or size budget) per texture in the Compression Settings dropdown. The plugin automatically chooses the optimal XUASTC LDR block size (4×4 through 12×12) or ETC1S to meet that target — no manual format knowledge required.
- **Platform-transparent transcoding**: At runtime, the plugin transcodes each KTX2 asset to the platform-native GPU format (BC5/BC7 on PC/console, ASTC on mobile) without any developer input. A single cooked asset serves all platforms.
- **Zero workflow changes**: Encoding happens at cook time via `ITextureFormatModule`. The cooked assets are standard `UTexture2D` objects, fully compatible with materials, streaming, and LOD.

This unifies what is currently a fragmented decision — "which format for which platform?" — into a single quality dial that works across all targets.

### 2. Automatic Per-Texture Optimization

Today, developers must manually assess each texture's role (hero vs. secondary, close-up vs. distant) and assign formats accordingly. A production-ready integration will include tooling to automate this:

- Analyze each texture's usage context (material slot, LOD range, screen-space coverage)
- Assign quality targets automatically based on perceptual importance
- Distribute a project-wide size budget optimally across the texture library

This kind of per-texture quality allocation is only possible with a continuous bitrate space like XUASTC LDR. Fixed-bitrate GPU formats (BC1, BC7) cannot offer it.

### 3. Mip Streaming Support

The current implementation loads only mip level 0 (full resolution). A production-ready integration requires full mip chain support and compatibility with UE5's texture streaming system:

- Encode and store all mip levels in the KTX2 container at cook time
- At runtime, integrate with `FStreamableRenderResourceState` so UE5's streaming manager can request individual mip levels on demand
- Reduce initial VRAM usage and support large open-world scenes where texture streaming is critical

Mip streaming support is a prerequisite for any production use case.

### 4. Direct Memory Transcoding

The current prototype writes a temporary file to disk before transcoding. The production implementation will transcode directly from the cooked asset's memory buffer, eliminating I/O overhead and making runtime loading competitive with native formats.
